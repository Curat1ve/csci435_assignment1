# csci435_assignment1
Repository for the first assignment in CSCI 435: Software Engineering.

## About the Program

Python was used for this assignment as it has good support for XML management and drawing libraries. It's also on a small enough scale to not require multiple objects and performance concerns are low due to limited inputs. 

The basic methodolgy used is Setup Script Execution -> Parse XML -> Draw Boxes -> Exit

Output for the pictures can be found in the folder Android_GUI_Highlighter_output

## Language and Libraries

This script is written in Python 3.12.5 (most recent version as of writing). To run it, you will need to install the following libraries:

Pillow, for image drawing: (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

LXML, for XML parsing: (https://lxml.de/)

All other referenced libraries come with Python 3.12.5

## Running the Program

To run the program in Windows, use the following command, assuming you're in the directory of the project: py Android_GUI_Highlighter.py Programming-Assignment-Data

In Linux / MacOS, assuming you have python added to your path, run: python Android_GUI_Highlighter.py Programming-Assignment-Data
